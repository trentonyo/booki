## Overview

- Live image recognition
- Highly performant*
- Modular

The platform takes periodic images from your screen and runs them through a 
highly performant image recognition processor against light data validation
defined for any given game**.

_* Tested (10/31/2024) with THE FINALS, no dropped frames at medium graphics._

_** Specialized scripts use the game's logic/rules to clean up noisy data and predict win probability over the 
course of the game, while it's being played._

## Design

Game state monitoring takes a frequentist approach.

Prediction takes a Bayesian approach.
